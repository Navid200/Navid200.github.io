# xDrip Documentation & Support
  
xDrip is an [open-source Android app](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip), developed, maintained and supported by volunteers, that you can use as a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).  
  
It lets you customize your alerts, follow (monitor) your child, parent or partner, perform statistical analysis, set targets, control and interact with different CGM devices, and a lot more.  
There is no financial incentive for any of the xDrip developers.  Each one of us either has diabetes or has a loved one who does.  We need and use xDrip ourselves.
